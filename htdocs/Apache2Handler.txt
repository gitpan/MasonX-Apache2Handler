NAME
    MasonX::Apache2Handler - experimental (alpha) Mason/mod_perl2 interface

SYNOPSIS
        use MasonX::Apache2Handler;
 
        my $ah = MasonX::Apache2Handler->new (..name/value params..);
        ...
        sub handler {
         my $r = shift;
         $ah->handle_request($r);
        }

DESCRIPTION
    MasonX::Apache2Handler is highly experimental ( alpha ) and should only
    be used in a test environment.

    MasonX::Apache2Handler is a clone of HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler changed
    to work under a pure mod_perl2 environment. The external interface is
    unchanged, see HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler.

    The actual changes I made can be found in the distribution in
    diff/ApacheHandler.diff ( made with 'diff -Naru' ... ).

    A HOTWO for MasonX::Apache2Handler may be found at HOWTO Run Mason with
    mod_perl2.
